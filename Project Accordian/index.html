          What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Answer: var is function-scoped and is hoisted to the top of its
          containing function. let and const are block-scoped and are not
          hoisted. let allows for reassignment of the variable value, while
          const does not

          <div class="question">What is the event loop in JavaScript?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            Answer: The event loop is a crucial concept in JavaScript that
            handles asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the message
            queue for new tasks and executes them in a non-blocking manner.
            JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one
            operation at a time. The event loop allows asynchronous operations
            (like fetching data or handling user input) to be managed without
            blocking the main thread.

            Explain the concept of closures in JavaScrip
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            Answer: A closure is a function bundled together with references to
            its outer variables, even after the outer function has finished
            executing. Closures allow for the creation of private variables and
            encapsulation of functionality. They are often used to create
            functions with persistent state or to create modular and reusable
            code
